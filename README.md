# OpenWeatherMap

This API is a virtualized sample of the OpenWeatherMap REST API.  Full details of the latter can be found at

The virtualized sample API is divided into the following groups: Current Weather Data, Data from Weather Stations, Weather Forecast.

Full details of the request-response pairs making up the sample API can be seen in the Editor tab.

Note in the "Current weather data by city name" pair, when executing, the parameter {city_name} can be replaced by any sample string in the request.  This string will be echoded in the response where {city_name} occurs.
